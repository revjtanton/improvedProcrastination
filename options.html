    <h1>Improved Procrastination</h1>
    <p>This extention will let you set a list of URL's you normally visit and waste time on.  Then it will let you set a list of other URL's you also like to visit, but maybe you don't think of them first.  Whenever you visit a site on the first list it will redirect you to a random URL on the second list.  Sometimes it'll redirect you to the site you were trying to initially visit.</p>
    <h2>For Example:</h2>
    <p>If you list Facebook as a site you visit too often but codeFights is a site you should visit more often then when you visit Facebook you'll sometimes, randomly, go to codeFights instead.</p>
